This is my first wild code Project. On this project i am creating a restaurant app were customers can order their food or drinks without having to look through a menu hard copy .But instead scan a Qr code or or a numerical code that will allow them to see the restaurants menu.

Benefits:
customers can just order without having to speak to a waiter.

add and de-select order as they pleases.
